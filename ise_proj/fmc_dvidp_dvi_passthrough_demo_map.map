WARNING:Place:1109 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <fmc_dvidp_dvii_clk> is placed at site <W14>. The corresponding
   BUFG component <video_clk_BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X2Y2>. There is
   only a select set of IOBs that can use the fast path to the Clocker buffer,
   and they are not being used. You may want to analyze why this problem exists
   and correct it. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE
   constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <fmc_dvidp_dvii_clk.PAD> allowing your
   design to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related
   to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly discouraged as
   it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error
   condition be corrected in the design.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
